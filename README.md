# DSA-Bootcamp

A lot of beginners and experienced programmers avoid learning Data Structures and Algorithms because it’s complicated and they think that there is no use of all the above stuff in real life.

Data structures and algorithms play a major role in implementing software and in the hiring process as well. A lot of students and professionals have this question that why these companies’ interviews are focused on DSA instead of language/frameworks/tools specific questions?

<!-- It is quite easy to learn new programming languages while using them in your projects. However, it is not the case with DSA. If you don’t know DSA well, you will find it challenging to optimize the code and solution for a problem. The profound uses of DSA have made it imperative for all those budding programmers and students to start learning it and succeed in their computer science career. It is also important for the employees already working in DSA to upskill themselves to keep abreast of the advancements in it. -->
